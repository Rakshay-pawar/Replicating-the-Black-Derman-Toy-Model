# Replicating-the-Black-Derman-Toy-Model
We delve into the construction and utilization of the Black-Derman-Toy model to construct an interest rate tree, based on the provided volatility and term structure data. Using the created tree, we calculate the expected future interest rates and compare them with initial forward rates.
